Upcoming:

    - Add the ability to add log messages to a note task, record the date that each entry was written.

    - Change the text on the button that currently says “Edit Task” to be “Create Task Data” if the task data has not yet been created.

    - Having a feature editor open and then closing the main window keeps the app open ?
      Maybe a warning during this condition

    - Record the datetime of CUD events and be able to view the history of that. 
      E.g. When did I close the task I’m currently looking at ? At what point did this feature move into the Complete state ?

    - Add the current datetime as a featurevar and make a way to parse datetime string formatting within feature template/task template titles, etc
      End goal being that a new feture can have the current date/time stamped into the title in the format desired

    - Save the sizes of things like the filter tree view, filter checkbox lists, where the grid splitters are and be able to restore these after restarting the program

    - Removing tasks from a feature doesn’t re-calculate the feature state. But it should.

    - Add a button or something in the filtering section to restore the default sorting of tasks in the main form.

    - In the dependency selector, where can choose the target state: Instead make it checkbox list where you can choose multiple target states.
      Any one of which will satisfy the dependency. This will require updating the dto, adding a dbupdate function and changing the code that
      determines if the task is closed, waitingForDependency, etc.

    - When clicking the edit button on an un-entered task row that has all the proper data,
      see if it is easy to do the insert first so it doesn’t come up with the message: A row must first be fully entered

    - Instead of popping up a messagebox with "Updated", change the color or mark something in the UI so it easy to just tell by looking at if it is saved or not.

    - Add a way for task types to add details to the result grid in the details section

    - Add a way to quickly mark a task as complete via the filter results grid

    - Shows the tasks sorted in the way the design plan indicates
