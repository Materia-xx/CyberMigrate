Upcoming:

    - To simulate the order that tasks must be completed in, within each system state add an order field that shows up and can be set in the feature editor.
      The program won’t enforce that one task is done before the other, but it should list them in this order in the feature editor 
      (list first by system state priority order, then by task order).

    - Add “Feature Overview”, a multi line extended version of the title.

    - Change the text on the button that currently says “Edit Task” to be “Create Task Data” if the task data has not yet been created.

    - When clicking the edit button on an un-entered task row that has all the proper data,
      see if it is easy to do the insert first so it doesn’t come up with the message: A row must first be fully entered

    - Instead of popping up a messagebox with "Updated", change the color or mark something in the UI so it easy to just tell by looking at if it is saved or not.

    - Add a way for task types to add details to the result grid in the details section

    - Add a way to quickly mark a task as complete via the filter results grid

    - Add more filter tools in the main UI
        - Textbox to search through titles, names and possibly task data and perform a customized search

    - Shows the tasks sorted in the way the design plan indicates

    - Update the program so that when a task state is updated that it also updates any open task dialog with the correct state.
