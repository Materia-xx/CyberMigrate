Upcoming:

    - Update the main UI to only show tasks for the current feature state and not all feature states
      But when a specific system state is selected, show all un-closed tasks within that state.
    - Split up the main rows shown in the filter grid to be a main row that represents the feature
      with expanded sub-rows for the tasks, maybe with another level in between that represent the system state
      Only expand the current feature system state. 
    - Add more filter tools in the main UI
        - Checkbox to Show closed items
        - Textbox to search through titles, names and possibly task data and perform a customized search
    - Shows the tasks sorted in the way the design plan indicates
    - Add the ability to add instanced tasks ad-hoc to already created features
    - Be able to click on the task "View" button in the main UI and see the task instance UI
    - Add in feature vars
    - Update the dependency task to display correctly for a task that has been instanced.
            During template editing mode it should allow setting dependencies on feature templates. 
            If not template then it should only list features that are not a template.
    - Implement the generic text based task and all current interface methods for it
    - Work on making the autoprogress methods of the tasks work and having the main program call this for the correct
            tasks on a regular interval
    - Put in the logic for the autoprogression of system state within a feature
    - Ability to manually change the task state via the task dialog (when the task is an instance)
    - Verify that a Task.AutoProgress call works to update any open task dialog with the correct state.
