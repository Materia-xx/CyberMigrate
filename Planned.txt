Upcoming:

    - Consider taking the "All" rule condition out and only using Any rules. Plus add a new rule type that just blindly sets the state that can be used to 
      set a feature to its final state if the rule processing makes it that far.
    - Refresh the main UI filtered items when the items change, maybe refresh a second or so after there have been no updates for a coupld seconds
      to void trying to rapidly refresh every time a record is updated during large sweeping updates.
    - Add a way for task types to add details to the result grid in the details section
    - Add a way to quickly mark a task as complete via the filter results grid
    - Update the main UI to show for different system states when those are selected in the filter tree.
    - Add more filter tools in the main UI
        - Checkbox to Show closed items
        - Checkbox to show hidden tasks 
            a new concept for feature dependency tasks, which don't need work done by themselves, it's auto-calculated to can be hidden in the UI.
            But the user may want to view it to reset the dependency details to another feature or just manually close it.
        - Textbox to search through titles, names and possibly task data and perform a customized search
    - Shows the tasks sorted in the way the design plan indicates
    - Add the ability to add instanced tasks ad-hoc to already created features
    - Add in feature vars
    - Work on making the autoprogress methods of the tasks work and having the main program call this for the correct
            tasks on a regular interval
    - Put in the logic for the autoprogression of system state within a feature
    - Verify that a Task.AutoProgress call works to update any open task dialog with the correct state.
