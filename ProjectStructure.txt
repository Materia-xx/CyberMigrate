CyberMigrate
    * The main program.

TaskBase
    * Tasks should reference this project as a base class

DataProvider
    * All interaction between the database is encapsulated here
    * Should not be referenced by tasks for the most part unless there is something specialized

Dto
    * Data transfer objects that flow back and forth between various parts of the program
    * Probably all projects will reference this
    * Has little to no functions itself, as much as possible this is just pure classes and properties (structure only).
